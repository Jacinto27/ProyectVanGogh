# Project VanGogh

This is an image comparison tool that takes an input image and returns three vanGogh paintings that are the most similar
alongside their similarity percentage. 

## Getting Started
This project was made using TensorFlow and SKlearn. It is required to install them alongside the vanGogh Image database.
