# Project VanGogh

This is an image comparison tool that takes an input image and returns three vanGogh paintings that are the most similar
alongside their similarity percentage. 

## Getting Started
This project was made using TensorFlow and SKlearn. It is required to install them alongside the vanGogh Image database.
Database can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ipythonx) authored by [innat](https://github.com/innat).

### Prerequisites
Check requirements.txt doc for libraries and versions used. 

Requires a TF-compatible GPU. I used NVIDIA packages.
